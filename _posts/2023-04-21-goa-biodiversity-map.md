The illustrative biodiversity map on Goa shows the different eco zones as well as an understanding of the different species and habitats in pictorial form.

**Teacher training handbooks focused on different aspects of biodiversity in Goa.** <br><br> This covered different issues and aspects of utilization and respect for the biodiversity in the state to help teachers disseminate this knowledge to school children.
