This was designed in two formats, one was a scroll, printed on cloth and packaged, to be used as a gift, the other printed in a fan fold format.

Two different papers were chosen to meet weight constraints and for wide distribution at the UN convention. The illustration style was based on indian miniature paintings, where the lotus is given symbolic meaning linked to the material contained in the text.
